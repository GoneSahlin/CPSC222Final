    "# Spotify Data Analysis\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Introduction: Briefly describe the project domain, the dataset, your hypotheses, and the classification task you implemented (e.g., what were you trying to classify in the dataset). You should also briefly describe your findings (e.g., what are your best classification results). See the project proposal guidelines in DA5 for more details on the requirements in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Introduction\n",
    "The domain of this project is the music domain. This is important to me because I am very interested in music. I listen to a lot of music on spotify, but I also play three instruments, trombone, guitar, and piano. Music is one of my hobbies, and I have spent a lot of time playing or listening to music. I want to find out more about my tendencies when listening to music on Spotify, such as what kind of music I listen to, and at what times do I tend to listen to music.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Introduction\n",
    "The dataset include the downloaded Spotify streaming history JSON files, `StreamingHistory0.json` and `StreamingHistory1.json`, and `Location History.json`. There are two of the Spotify files, because they have a maximum length of 10000 instances, which is not enough to hold all of my Spotify data from the past year. The Spotify data has the following attributes:  \n",
    "* endTime - what time the song stopped playing, in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:SS (e.g. \"2019-09-17 00:01\")\n",
    "* artistName - name of the artist (e.g. \"Guns N' Roses\")\n",
    "* trackName - name of the song (e.g. \"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\")\n",
    "* msPlayed - how much of the song was played in milliseconds (e.g. 336000)\n",
    "\n",
    "The other dataset is from Google Takeout, and is my location history. It contains the following attributes:\n",
    "* timestampMs - the time the data was taken, given in Unix time in milliseconds\n",
    "* latitudeE7 - the latitude of my location * 10^7\n",
    "* longitudeE7 - the longitude of my location * 10^7\n",
    "* accuracy - the accuracy of the coordinate data\n",
    "* activities - predicted activity, e.g. (\"still\", \"in_vehicle\", \"on_bicycle\")\n",
    "\n",
    "More data will be pulled from the Spotify API, including the following attributes:\n",
    "* duration_ms - the length of the song in milliseconds\n",
    "* tempo -  the speed of the song in beats per minute\n",
    "* acousticness -  how likely the song is to be acoustic, on a scale from 0 (least likely to be acoustic) to 1 (most likely to be acoustic)\n",
    "* danceability -  how suitable a track is for dancing, on a scale from 0 (least danceable) to 1 (most danceable) \n",
    "* energy -  how energetic the track is on a scale from 0 (least energetic) to 1 (most energetic), energetic tracks are fast, loud, and noisy.\n",
    "* instrumentalness - how likely the song is to have vocals, in a scale from 0 (most likely contains vocals) to 1 (most like instrumental)\n",
    "* liveness - how likely the presence of an audience is in the recording, on a scale from 0 (least likely to have been performed live) to 1 (most likely to have been performed live)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "I am predicting that my listening habits change when going from Seattle to Spokane, because my lifestyle changes. I think that I will listen to more relaxing music in Spokane, because I often listen while studying. I don't think that the machine learning algorithm predicting whether I will skip a song will work very well, because I don't think there is a strong correlation between the attributes and whether the song was skipped or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stakeholders for this would be me, Spotify, and record labels. Thiswould impact me because it would allow me to better understand my habits, and could inform me of what kinds of music I enjoy listening to. The stakeholders interested in these results would be me, Spotify, and record labels. Spotify would be impacted because if they did a similar analysis on the rest of their listeners, they could find out what songs they should recommend. Record labels would want to know so that they could release songs that people would like.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "### Downloading My Spotify Data\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I needed to request my spotify streaming history, which can be done [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/). There will then be an email sent to confirm the data request. It can take up to 30 days for Spotify to prepare the data for download, when it will then be sent in an email with a link to the download. This will download a folder named `my_spotify_data`, which contains multiple JSON files. The files of interest are named `StreamingHistory0.json` and `StreamingHistory1.json`. These files contain the Spotify streaming history of the user for the past year. Each file contains 10000 instances, so there will be more of these files depending on how many songs have been listened to in the last year. These files can be read into a pandas `DataFrame` with the following code."

I want to know if the average tempo of my music changes with with these lifestlye changes. I predict that the average tempo of songs played in Seattle is faster than those played in Spokane, because in Spokane I normally listen to music while I am working on schoolwork, and I think that I play slower, more relaxing music while studying.\n",

    "## Classification\n",
    "The class we are predicting is \"skipped\". Which tells if the song was skipped before it was over. The values are \"yes\" and \"no\". \"yes\" means that the song was skipped, and \"no\" means that it was not. The stakeholders interested in these results would be me, Spotify, and record labels. I would be impacted by the results because it would allow me to predict what songs I will like. Spotify would be impacted because if they did a similar analysis on the rest of their listeners, they could find out what songs they should recommend. Record labels would want to know so that they could release songs that people would like.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this using both kNN and a decision tree. I predict that the decision tree will be more accurate, but that neither method will be very accurate.\n",
    "### KNN\n",
    "First we will try to predict \"skipped\" using k nearest neighbors. We will do this using sklearn. The first step in doing this is to create a new `DataFrame` for the classification. We will need to scale some of the values, and we want to keep the values that are currently stored in cleaned_df. y is the attribute being classified, in this case, \"skipped\". x is the rest of the data, but we have removed the columns that aren't helpful. We are dropping \"artistName\", \"trackName\", and \"skipped\" because they are class labels. \"msPlayed\" needs to be dropped because it would be too easy to predict \"skipped\", because \"skipped\" is calculated off of \"msPlayed\". We are dropping \"longitude\" and \"latitude\" because they can be summarized better by \"city\"."

This makes it so that a lot of the skipped songs are next to eachother.

    "The dataset was very difficult to gather and clean, and most of my time was spent doing this. At the start of the semester, we were taught that data scientists spend most of their time cleaning data, and I probably should have expected that this would be true for me as well. Cleaning the data was very frustrating, because a lot of songs didn't work with the API. Gathering the data from the API took a really long time, because there are 13,000 instances, and each instance needed to request from the API three times, which makes ~40,000 requests from the API in total. This was the most difficult part of the project. I could have sped this up by requesting 10 data for 10 songs at a time, and by avoiding repeat songs. I had a lot of errors when I tried to do this, so I decided it would be easier to do it one at a time. In hindsight, I should have spent more time doing trying to do this, as it probably would have saved me time in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "This impacts me by informing me more about my listening habits. It could impact how Spotify recommends me music, and could impact how record labels release music. Spotify and record labels could make more money by using machine learning, and I'm sure that they are already doing this. This could have ethical impacts because machine learning algorithms could be biased, and might favor certain songs or artists. This would make it very difficult for some artists to get into the industry, because if there songs weren't being recommended then nobody would hear their music."
